# **Project 2: Salary Prediction Regression Model**
  - This project involves creating a Regression model that predicts your salary given years of experience.
  - A Regression model is a type of ML that simply outputs a number. 
  - Before starting this project, take some time and introduce the different kinds of ML. [Microsoft has good short overview.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/fundamentals-machine-learning/1-introduction?pivots=text)
  - In this project, we are introducing two new libraries: Pandas and Sci-Kit Learn (Sklearn).  

## **By the end, the student should know:** 
  - What the libraries Pandas and Sci-Kit Learn are (perhaps not necessarily how to work with them yet)
  - What the different types of ML are (especially the difference between Supervised and Unsupervised)
  - What Regression is, specifically Linear Regression


There's a lot of plotting data in this project - while not required for training and running the model, it certainly helps the student visualize what is happening

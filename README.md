Hello! These are the projects I've been using the teach the kids about AI and ML. When I teach them, I try not to delve too deep into the math behind it- more about concepts and the act of ML. 

The first few lessons are focused on Neural Networks and classic, traditional ML. These typically involve taking in data, constructing a model, and making predictions based on the data.
The next few lessons after are focused on Transformers, a type of ML model that LLMs (Large Language Models) are primarily made of. 

I often spend several weeks on one project, and making sure they understand (at least conceptually) how everything works. 

This curriculum also does not cover all there is to know about AI and ML - I've been constructing these based on feedback from students and finding out what they want to learn about AI.

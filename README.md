Hello! These are the projects I've been using the teach the kids about AI and ML. When I teach them, I try not to delve too deep into the math behind it- more about concepts and the act of ML. 

The first few lessons are focused on Neural Networks and classic, traditional ML. These typically involve taking in data, constructing a model, and making predictions based on the data.
The next few lessons after are focused on Transformers, a type of ML model that LLMs (Large Language Models) are primarily made of. 

I often spend several weeks on one project, and making sure they understand (at least conceptually) how everything works. 

I'll often also structure these projects into 3 steps: 
  - Data-Preprocessing: where we clean and format our data
  - Training: Where we define our model and train it over the data
  - Inferencing (Fancy way of saying "Use it"): Often testing the model using a testing dataset and comparing answers. 

This curriculum also does not cover all there is to know about AI and ML - I've been constructing these based on feedback from students and finding out what they want to learn about AI.

# **Project 1: Handwritten NN from MNIST**
  - This project involves creating a Neural Network model that detects handwritten digits from pixel image data. It is a lot simpler than it sounds, trust me. 
  - For a very comprehensive overview of this project, I HIGHLY recommend watching [3Blue1Brown's video on the basics on Neural Networks.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk). It directly covers this project on a conceptual basis, and explains how NNs work and how they "learn".

## **By the end, the student should know:** 
  - What the libraries Keras, Tensorflow, Matplotlib, and Numpy are (perhaps not necessarily how to work with them yet)
  - What a NN is, how is it constructed (input, hidden, output layers, activations, neurons, etc)
  - Why we divide a dataset between training and testing
  - What "normalization" is, and why we do it
  - The difference between the compile() and fit() functions


A lot of the content in here might go over their head a bit - that's okay! We are diving into the deep end with this. Future lessons compound on the basics we introduce here.
